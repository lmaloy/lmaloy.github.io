| **Eyebrow Design & Tinting** <br> *$100 / 45 min* <br> <br> After a brief consultation discussing where your brows are and where you would like them to be, an Austrian vegetable-based dye is color-customized for you and applied. Brows are tinted at the beginning of the service to darken the baby blonde hairs that hide inside and around the brow, thus giving Lauren a fuller shape to work with. This is followed by thoughtful trimming and an expertly restrained approach to shaping with a tweezer. The final step is a one on one tutorial on your ideal brow shape for your face and how to maintain the look at home. |
| **Eyebrow Design** <br> *$75 / 35 min* |
| **Eyebrow Cleanup** <br> *$30 / 10 min* |
| **Eyebrow tint** <br> *$30 / 15 min* |
| **Keratin Lash Lift Enhancement and Tint** <br> *$110 / 45 min* <br> <br> Lauren’s lash lift technique boosts and lifts the natural eyelashes without having to rely on false lashes or harmful adhesives. This treatment works by first coaxing each individual hair in to place. This process is the most important part and is customized to each person’s face shape and their desired result. A special pigment infusion is then applied, followed by a dark tint. The result? Fluffy, natural looking lashes that curve upwards.  The lash lift is a relaxing, safe service and the result is about as low maintenance as it gets. The effect lasts for the natural life cycle of the eyelash, which is about 8 weeks.  | 
| **Keratin Lash Lift without Tint** <br> *$85 / 30 min* |
